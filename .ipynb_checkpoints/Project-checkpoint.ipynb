    "This will be a notebook to try to find a correlation between different datasets found in the https://www.ny.gov/programs/open-ny website.\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to use all the abilities learned throughout the ADML course and make use of the data found here to make a business report on the subject.\n",
    "For this we are going to be using the following datasets:\n",
    " - Hate_Crimes_by_County_and_Bias_Type__Beginning_2010_20241030\n",
    " - Index_Crimes_by_County_and_Agency__Beginning_1990_20241030\n",

    "We can make a few hyphothesis with just the titles alone, like what areas have more crime, is crime related to salary and taxes, are hate crimes and suicides related? Or are state taxes and fees that arbitrary by zone.\n",
    "We can use this common themes to make a roadmap of what we can do and how to start.\n",

    "### **First things first**\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to prepare the data so we can start digging for clues. This process includes porting the datasets using pandas, taking notes of what we can use for each dataset, cleaning NaNs, deleting useless columns and showing the data for easier visualization.\n",

    "What relations can we gather with these datasets? Can we make joined datasets? Do we need anything else? This part is where we are going to make experiments of all kind so we can try to find something usefull.\n",

Do we need to find more relations between the datasets using machine learning? Does the algorithm need to be supervised or unsupervised? Do we need to restart the process?
